## Challenge: 
The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is challenging you to use your machine learning skills to develop a model capable of categorizing plant specimen images. 

## Goal:
To use image classification machine learning techniques to train a model capable of distinguishing among the image classes represented in this dataset (i.e., sorting images into classes) with a high level of accuracy. Examples of image classes in the dataset include: “Animal specimens”, “Biocultural specimens”, “Microscope slides” (all non-standard), and "Ordinary pressed specimens" (standard). 

## Results:
Achieved a model with 97.8 accuracy score.
